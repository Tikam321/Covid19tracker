        <h2>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) advice for the public</h2>
        </div>

   <div class="row">
   <div class="card card-body" style="margin-bottom:3rem;">
     <h4 class="card-title">Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. Most countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and many are experiencing outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.</h4>
   </div>

 <div class="card card-body" style="margin-bottom:3rem;">
   <h4 class="card-title"> Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.</h4>
   </div>

   <div class="card card-body" style="margin-bottom:3rem;">
     <h4 class="card-title">Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and others. Why? When someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person has the disease.</h4>
   </div>


 <div class="card card-body" style="margin-bottom:3rem;">
   <h4 class="card-title">Avoid going to crowded places. Why? Where people come together in crowds, you are more likely to come into close contact with someone that has COIVD-19 and it is more difficult to maintain physical distance of 1 metre (3 feet).</h4>
 </div>
 <div class="card card-body" style="margin-bottom:3rem;">
   <h4 class="card-title">Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and infect you.</h4>
 </div>

 <div class="card card-body" style="margin-bottom:3rem;">
   <h4 class="card-title">Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately and wash your hands. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene, you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.</h4>
 </div>

 <div class="card card-body" style="margin-bottom:3rem;">
   <h4 class="card-title">Stay home and self-isolate even with minor symptoms such as cough, headache, mild fever, until you recover. Have someone bring you supplies. If you need to leave your house, wear a mask to avoid infecting others. Why? Avoiding contact with others will protect them from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.</h4>
 </div>
 <div class="card card-body" style="margin-bottom:3rem;">
   <h4 class="card-title">If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention, but call by telephone in advance if possible and follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.</h4>
